# dice-on-a-yacht
A small prototype game as an example. I was given a description of a game called Dice On A Yacht and asked to create a tool which provided two pieces of functionality:
- Provided a set of values for 5 8-sided dice, return the best scoring category to choose.
- Provided a set of values for 5 8-sided dice AND a category, return the score for the dice in that category.

In order to achieve this, I created an Enumeration of the categories, broke the scoring down into its common elements, and created a command-line interface for entering the dice/categories.

I also noted (in the comments throughout the project) the shortcomings of the game as described, methods for improvement, and future improvements that would benefit this tool.
